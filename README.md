# Discordcaptcha
A simple discord captcha bot template.
-------------------------------------

## Usage:
Don't forget to add a `.env` file and add your discord bot token there in the form of:
```bash
TOKEN=your_token_here
```
You will also have to add the verified role id inside the `config.json` file.

To then launch it, you can just do `node server.js`.
